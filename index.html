        <h1>Overview: Digital Clinic A/B Testing</h1>
        <p>Below are two versions of a Digital Clinic prototype in which users can log-in to view medical information, financial 
            reports, and schedule appointments among other tasks one would normally perform at an actual clinic. For the purpose of this 
            study, users of the site were tasked with scheduling an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024.
        </p>

                <p class="caption">Version A User Interface</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="assets/version-B.png" alt="Version B Screenshot">
                <p class="caption">Version B User Interface</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Version B, displays a UI modification made to the original webpage, version A, intended to facilitate users' ability to schedule 
            their respective appointments. A/B testing allows designers to observe users' behavioral response to UI changes before fully launching
            them into production. This process helps idneitfy whether these modifications are effective in achieving the intended user response by monitoring
            key performance indices. 
        </p>

    <div class="part-1">
        <h1>Data Collection</h1>
        <p> To observe behavior on either webpage, 31 users were assigned the task describe above and performed it on both the A and B versions. They first took turns
            completing the task on single computer, then users walked around the room performing the tasks on each other's laptops and collecting data for their
            own respective UI changes. The Following <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1moE74CL-gxpeeasSSmwHYLLWiFaT17hI/view?usp=sharing">data points</a> were collected for each user session on my version B design
            and compared to those from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rBa3MVXeeD59lT4x1NPAoGa2IjrrRLrq/view?usp=sharing">version A</a>: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>uid</strong> - Unique identifier for each user</li>
            <li><strong>version</strong> - Version (A or B) of the website that the user interacted with</li>
            <li><strong>timestamp_load</strong> - The time (in milliseconds) elapsed since the epoch</li>
            <li><strong>time_on_page</strong> - Total time (in milliseconds) that the user spent on the page</li>
            <li><strong>time_to_first_click</strong> - The time (in milliseconds) it took for the user to execute his/her first click</li>
            <li><strong>mouse_move_distance</strong> - The total distance (in pixels) of the userâ€™s mouse movements</li>
            <li><strong>num_clicks</strong> - The number of times the user clicked on the screen</li>
            <li><strong>did_misclick</strong> - A boolean flag indicating if the user pushed a button external to the task</li>
            <li><strong>did_succeed</strong> - A boolean flag indicating if the user successfully completed the task</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="part-2">
        <h1>Metric Optimization</h1>
        <p>
            The objective of the UI modifications in version B were to make the appointment scheduling practice easier for users. In order to
            determine whether these changes were affected, performance metrics that quantify the user's ability to schedule the correct appointment. 
            The following metrics were chosen to observe the length of the task, how error-prone users behaved, and how much effort was required for users
            to navigate the UI correctly:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>time_on_page</strong></li>
            <li><strong>did_misclick</strong></li>
            <li><strong>mouse_move_distance</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The A/B tests will focus on these metrics as they best measure the user's successful completion of the assigned task. The 
            mouse move distance in particular seeks to verify how logical the UI layout is and whether or not it is accessible. A short 
            mouse movement distance will indicate less time spent "mindlessly" looking for the scheduling button and it also speaks to 
            how accessible the new design is for users with limited mobility, who might often frequent a digital clinic. These were 
            the values calculated for each metric and their respective versions, calculations for all test can be found

        <h1>Statistical Testing</h1>
        <p>Having collected the necessary data and identified the key performance metrics, the A/B testing now makes use of various statistical tests to 
            evaluate the difference in data collected for each UI version. 
        </p>
        
        <h2> Time Spent on Page One-Tailed T Test </h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> - There is no statistical difference between the amount of time spent on page A versus
            page B.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> - The time spent on page B is statistically less than the time spent on page B. This is 
            page B because the bright orange color will help users identify the button sooner.</li>
            <li><strong>Predicted Result</strong> - considering the brighter color used on the button and the removal of the redundant "view
                appointment" button, I think it makes sense that the null hypothesis will be rejected. Moreover, everyone in the studio used every other
                students' computer, eventually they would have likely become quicker at completing the task regardless.</s></li>
            <li><strong>Selected Test</strong> - One-Tailed T Test</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When observing the different amount of time spent on either A or B, we hypothesize that the time spent on page B will be lower. Since a 
            direction is assumed and we are comparing a variable in two different groups we will perform a one-tailed t-test (left-tailed t test). These 
            were the results of the test:

        </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Value</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Degrees of Freedom</strong></td>
                    <td>43.915</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>T-score</strong></td>
                    <td>-1.851</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>P-value</strong></td>
                    <td>0.035</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            <strong>Summary: </strong>
            The one-tailed t-test comparing the time spent on page between version A and version B yielded a t-score of -1.851 with 
            approximately 43.915 degrees of freedom and a corresponding p-value of 0.035. With a significance level set at 0.05, the 
            p-value indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean time spent on page between the two 
            versions. Specifically, version B exhibited a significantly lower mean time spent on page compared to version A. This 
            finding suggests that the modifications implemented in version B may have led to a more efficient user experience, potentially 
            resulting in users spending less time on the page while achieving the same task completion rates. 
        </p>

        <h2> Misclicks Chi-Square Test </h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> - There is no statistical difference between the misclick frequency on page A and B.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> - There is a statistical difference between the misclick frequency on page A and B.</li>
            <li><strong>Predicted Result</strong> - while the changes made to the UI in version B make the button more visible, the changes to 
            the date and office location were fairly subtle. As a result, I do not blieve there will be much of a difference in the misclick rates
            for either group.</s></li>
            <li><strong>Selected Test</strong> - Chi-Square Test</li>
        </ul>

        <p> 
            In this case, we are observing the rate of misclicks between users on page A and users on page B. Since we are analzying different
            frequencies across groups, we will use a Chi-Square Test. These were the results of the test:

            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Degrees of Freedom</strong></td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Chi-Square</strong></td>
                    <td>3.951</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>P-value</strong></td>
                    <td>0.047</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
            <strong>Summary: </strong>The test results suggest a discrepency in misclick frequencies with a chi-square value of 3.951. The null hypothesis can be rejected
            given the associated p-value of approximately 0.047. The p-value is only slightly below the significance level, thus weakly supporting the 
            alternative hypothesis. These findings suggest that there are meaningful differences in user behavior or outcomes between version A and version B. This test does not however, suggest
            whether UI B has a lower misclick rate. Given that Sample B's misclick rate was lower than Sample A's, we might be able to infer this is
            the case with the support of the chi-square test's p-value. However, further analysis 
            may be warranted to identify the features or design elements associated with the observed discrepancies.

        <h2> Mouse Distance Two-Tailed T Test </h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> - There is no statistical difference between the mouse move distance on page A versus
            page B.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> - The mouse move distance on page B is statistically lower than that on page A, because
                the brighter button color will allow users to identify it sooner and they will spend less time searching the page with their mouse.</li>
            <li><strong>Predicted Result</strong> - I think that the null hypothesis will be rejected, since users will be able to identify the buttons
            sooner and as they continue to perform the same task they will be able to identify the correct appointment slot with less mouse movement.</s></li>

        <p>
            <strong>Summary: </strong> The results of the one-tailed t-test comparing the mouse move distance between sample A and 
            sample B reveal a statistically significant difference. With a p-value of approximately 0.000842, which is below the 
            significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that the mean mouse move distance for sample B 
            is significantly lower than that for sample A. These findings are crucial in the context of A/B testing for the digital 
            clinic site. A lower mouse move distance in sample B suggests that users interacting with this version exhibit more 
            efficient navigation behavior, potentially indicating a more intuitive and user-friendly interface design. Therefore, 
            implementing the modifications introduced in sample B may lead to improved user experience and engagement on the digital 
            clinic site, ultimately contributing to the site's effectiveness in facilitating appointments and providing services to 
            users.

        <h1>Testing Shortcomings</h1>
        <p>
            In each of the tests conducted the null hypothesis was rejected in support of the alternative hypothesis. I think the data
            was largely skewed by the data collection method. Overtime, I assume individuals became accustomed to the task and were able to
            identify the appropriate button much quicker, regardless of any UI changes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think this was seen most evidently in the weak p-value found in the Misclick Chi-Square test. Nonetheless, more A/B testing and
            larger data samples are likely necessary in order to effectively draw conclusions from version B's performance versus version A.
